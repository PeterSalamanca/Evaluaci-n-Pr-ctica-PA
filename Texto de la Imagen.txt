Linux is a family of open-source Unix operating systems based on the Linux Kernel.
They include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, openSUSE, and Red Hat. Using Linux to
manage a Virtual Private Server (VPS) is common practice.

When operating Linux, you need to use a shell - a program that gives you access to
the operating system's services. Most Linux distributions use a graphical user
interface (GUI), making them beginner-friendly.

However, we recommend utilizing the command-line interface (CLI) because it's
quicker and offers more control. Tasks that require multiple steps on the GUI can be
done in a matter of seconds by entering commands into the CLI.

So if you want to use Linux, learning the common utilities or commands will go a
long way. This article will discuss the 40 basic commands to help you use your Linux
distro effectively.
